USPGameDev's Programming Tutorial
=================================

This repository contains a series of lessons with which one may learn the
basics of game programming. Start from [Level 0](level_00) if you don't
have the LÃ–VE game framework setup yet (if you don't know what that is, then
you probably need to go there!). The real lessons start from [Level
1](level_01) onwards.

Feel free to submit any doubts as issues in this repository!
